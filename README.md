This repository contains a Python script implementing collaborative filtering using matrix factorization with TensorFlow. Collaborative filtering is a technique used in recommendation systems to predict user preferences for items based on past interactions.

Requirements:
Python 3.x
TensorFlow
NumPy

Explanation:
The collaborative_filtering.py script performs the following steps:

Loads a sample user-item matrix representing user-item interactions (e.g., ratings).
Converts the user-item matrix to a TensorFlow tensor.
Initializes user and item embeddings with random values.
Computes predictions using matrix factorization.
Masks known ratings in the user-item matrix for loss calculation.
Defines a loss function as the mean squared error between predicted and actual ratings.
Optimizes the model using the Adam optimizer.
Trains the model for a specified number of epochs.
Provides recommendations for a specific user based on the learned embeddings.

Customization:
You can customize the following parameters in the script:
user_item_matrix: Input your own user-item matrix.
latent_dim: Set the dimensionality of latent factors.
learning_rate: Adjust the learning rate for optimization.
num_epochs: Set the number of training epochs.
